# Testing

## Playback characterisation tests

These tests record how playlist and soundboard playback behave today. The playback engine is due to be rewritten in WP4, and these tests are the specification for that rewrite: a rewrite that keeps them green behaves the same for the user. Where a test pins a known bug, its name says so and it is marked `it.fails`. When that bug is fixed, change the test to a normal `it`.

### Running them

From the project folder:

```
yarn test                                        # every test
yarn test src/player/features/playlists          # playlist tests only
yarn test src/player/features/soundboards        # soundboard tests only
yarn test:coverage                               # with a coverage report in coverage/index.html
```

No audio is played. `howler` is replaced by a fake (`src/player/test/fakeHowler.ts`) that records every call and lets a test fire Howler's events ("load", "play", "end", "fade", "loaderror") by hand. Timers are faked, so a 10-second sound with a 100 ms fade-out is tested in milliseconds.

### What each file pins

| Test file | What it covers |
| --- | --- |
| `playlists/playlistsSlice.test.ts` | Playlist library: add/remove/edit playlists and tracks, new tracks added at the top, drag-to-reorder, edits without an id throw. |
| `playlists/playlistPlaybackSlice.test.ts` | Queue logic: starting a queue (shuffled and not), turning shuffle on/off keeps the current track, reordering, removing a track before/at/after the current one, adding tracks keeps the current track, and the transport state (play, stop, volume, mute, repeat). Shuffle is replaced by "reverse the list", so orders are exact. |
| `playlists/usePlaylistPlayback.test.tsx` | Next, previous and "track ended" for every combination of repeat (off/track/playlist) and shuffle, including wrap-around at both ends; "previous" restarts the track when more than 5 s in; the fixed 1000 ms cross-fade on a track change and unloading of the old track; errors show "Unable to play track: &lt;title&gt;". |
| `soundboards/soundboardsSlice.test.ts`, `soundboardPlaybackSlice.test.ts` | Soundboard library and the list of sounds currently playing. |
| `soundboards/Sound.test.ts` | One sound's fades and loops for every fade-in/fade-out/loop combination, the cross-faded loop releasing its audio (500 loops), stop with and without fade, and seek moving the fade-out point. |
| `soundboards/useSoundboardPlayback.test.tsx` | Playing, stopping, seeking; a non-looping sound is removed when it ends; errors show "Unable to play sound: &lt;title&gt;". |

The navigation logic in `usePlaylistPlayback.ts` exists three times (in `next`, `previous` and the track-end handler). The navigation table in its test file runs the same cases through all three, so WP4 can merge them into one function and check nothing changed. They differ in one place: with repeat "track", the end handler restarts the track by calling `play()`, while next/previous only seek to 0.

### Known bugs these tests document

- **QUEUE-1** (`playlistPlaybackSlice.test.ts`, `it.fails`): with shuffle off, removing a track from the playing playlist can make a different track "current". `removeTrackFromQueue` always walks the shuffled order, which only matches the playlist order by chance.
- Characterisation only, not marked as bugs: `startQueue` with a track id that is not in the list gives `current: -1`; removing the current track when it is last in the shuffled order also gives `current: -1`.

### Helpers for new tests

- `src/player/test/fakeHowler.ts`: use it with `vi.mock("howler", () => import("../../test/fakeHowler"))`. `FakeHowl.instances` lists every Howl created; `FakeHowl.reset()` belongs in `beforeEach`.
- `src/player/test/createPlayerStore.ts`: a Redux store with the real reducers and no saving to disk, for hook and component tests.

## End-to-end checks of Kenku FM's features

These Playwright tests start the packaged app and use it the way a person would, to show it still does everything Kenku FM did. How to build and run them: `docs/DEVELOPING.md` > End-to-end tests.

| Spec file | What it covers |
| --- | --- |
| `e2e/smoke.spec.ts` | The app starts with its main window and player; nothing fails at start-up; the problem check itself notices a Content-Security-Policy refusal. |
| `e2e/playlists.spec.ts` | Create, rename and delete a playlist; add two tracks from disk; play one and see the time move; pause and resume; next and previous with wrap-around (repeat starts as "playlist"); repeat track keeps a short track going and repeat off lets it end; shuffle on/off; volume slider, mute and unmute; edit and delete a track (deleting the playing track stops playback); play a playlist from its card on the home page; a picture from disk as a custom background. |
| `e2e/soundboards.spec.ts` | Create a soundboard; add a sound without fades (Web Audio) and one with fades (audio element); play once and see it end by itself; stop early; loop with cross-fades and with Howler's own loop; stop from the player bar; sound volume; edit name and fade; delete a sound and the soundboard. |
| `e2e/persistence.spec.ts` | Playlists, tracks, soundboards, sound loop setting, bookmarks, player volume and repeat, and the remote port survive quitting and restarting with the same data folder; the restored track still plays. |
| `e2e/tabs.spec.ts` | Open a local web page from the address bar, follow a link, Back, Forward, Reload, close the tab; bookmark a page, open the bookmark, edit it (a refused address keeps the dialog open), delete it; `file:///etc/passwd` in the address bar shows a message and opens nothing. |
| `e2e/settings.spec.ts` | Token field and "Where do I get my token?" link (opens in the system browser); a bad token ends in "Error connecting to bot: …" and the form is usable again; Clear Cache removes website cookies; the version number is shown. One test is marked as an expected failure (see below). |
| `e2e/remote.spec.ts` | Remote switched on in Settings on a free port; `GET /v1/playlist`, `PUT /v1/playlist/play` (track and playlist), `GET /v1/playlist/playback`, `PUT /v1/playlist/playback/pause` and `/play`, `GET /v1/soundboard`, `PUT /v1/soundboard/play`, `GET /v1/soundboard/playback`, `PUT /v1/soundboard/stop`, each checked against the player; switching it off closes the port. |
| `e2e/carryOver.spec.ts` | FND-1: a library made in `<appData>/Kenku FM` appears in Cue Desk on its first normal start, the carry-over record says "copied", and later changes in Cue Desk leave the Kenku FM library alone (Linux only, where `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` moves appData). |
| `e2e/capture.spec.ts` | Tab audio capture for Discord (SEC-3). |

Every test also fails if any page logged a console error, threw an uncaught error, broke a Content-Security-Policy rule or was refused by the IPC guard, or if the main process crashed (`e2e/fixtures/problems.ts`).

### Known issues these tests document

- Fixed during WP1: error messages used to sit at the bottom left, over the Settings panel's Done button, and were hidden from screen readers while Settings was open. They now appear at the top centre, outside the app root (`ErrorToast`), and `settings.spec.ts` checks both.
- The shuffle button does not say whether shuffle is on (no `aria-pressed`); the test reads the icon colour. The custom-background address field's label is on its wrapper, not on the input.
- Closing a website tab while its capture is still starting no longer logs "Unable to start stream for web view" (fixed in WP1); `tabs.spec.ts` still waits briefly before closing tabs.

## Current player fixes (WPL)

Fixes to the current player (`src/player`), which the new interface replaces later.

| Test file | What it covers |
| --- | --- |
| `features/idleWakeUps.test.tsx` | PERF-1: counts every timer and animation-frame callback (`test/countWakeUps.ts`) over a minute of fake time with both playback hooks mounted. Before: 3,750 a minute with nothing played, 7,500 with a track paused or playing. Now: none when idle (at most one last tick after a pause or stop), one a second while a track plays. |
| `features/remoteListeners.test.tsx` | PERF-1: the remote API listeners are registered once (before: 311 re-registrations in one minute of playback) and still answer with the current state and call the current callbacks. |
| `app/throttledStorage.test.ts`, `app/store.test.ts` | PERF-6: while the mouse button or a key is held (a slider drag), the library and player settings are saved at most once a second, and the final value as soon as the user lets go (or the page loses focus, is hidden or reloads). Other changes are saved at once, as before. Before: 100 saves for a 3-second, 100-step drag; now 4. |
| `playlists/usePlaylistPlayback.test.tsx` ("deleting the playing track"), `playlists/TrackItem.test.tsx` | BUG-8: deleting the playing track, or its playlist, stops and unloads it and clears the player bar; nothing (play key, remote, next) can resume it; a track still loading after a skip carries on. |

End-to-end: `playlists.spec.ts` also checks that the player bar shows no title, time or media-key metadata after the playing track is deleted and that another track then plays; `persistence.spec.ts` checks that a volume change and a rename made just before quitting are kept.

Saving is not delayed outside a held button or key because Electron destroys the player view without running its `pagehide` or `beforeunload` handlers when the app quits (`BrowserViewManagerMain.removeAllBrowserViews` closes and destroys at once), so a held-back save would be lost.
